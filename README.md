overview

(Normalization)
Normalization is a database design process used to organize data in a database efficiently. Its main goals are:
Eliminate data redundancy – avoid storing the same data in multiple places.
Ensure data consistency – changes in one place automatically reflect everywhere.
Improve data integrity – reduce errors and anomalies when inserting, updating, or deleting data.
